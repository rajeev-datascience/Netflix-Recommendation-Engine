# Netflix-Recommendation-Engine
Project Overview
Customer behavior and its prediction lie at the core of every business model. From stock exchanges and e-commerce to automobile industries and even presidential elections, predictions serve a crucial purpose. Most predictions are based on the data available about a person’s activity, either online or in-person.

Recommendation engines are essential manifestations of the desired predictability of user activity. These engines not only provide information but also offer strategies to further increase user interaction with the platform. In today’s world, OTT platforms and streaming services have taken up a significant portion of the retail and entertainment industry. Organizations like Netflix and Amazon analyze user activity patterns and suggest products that better suit the user’s needs and choices.

For the purpose of this project, we will be creating one such recommendation engine from the ground up, where every single user, based on their area of interest and ratings, would be recommended a list of movies best suited for them.
